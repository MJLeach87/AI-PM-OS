## Template Usage Tips

**Flexibility Reminders**:
- **Depth Varies by Importance**: Critical trends deserve deep dives; monitoring-level trends need brief summaries
- **Recency Matters**: Trend analyses age quickly - note research date and update if >3 months old
- **Combine Trends**: Related trends can be analyzed together (e.g., "AI + Async Collaboration Trends")
- **Skip Irrelevant Sections**: Not all trends have competitive landscapes or quantified market data

**Quality Signals**:
- **Evidence-based**: Strong trend analyses cite multiple independent sources (not single analyst report)
- **Balanced perspective**: Consider both opportunity and risk (avoid hype or cynicism)
- **Actionable**: Good trend analysis leads to clear decisions or next steps

**Common Pitfalls**:
- **Recency bias**: Conflating recent buzz with long-term trend
- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeking evidence that supports pre-existing beliefs
- **Analysis paralysis**: Over-researching trends instead of testing hypotheses
