# Customer Interview Synthesis Template

**Template Type**: Optional Reference Structure
**Purpose**: Provide a suggested format for synthesizing customer interview insights - adapt, combine, or skip based on your discovery objectives
**Philosophy**: Like the NSM framework (teams choose metrics that fit their context), this template is a tool in your toolkit, not a mandatory format

---

## When to Use This Template

**Consider referencing this structure when**:
- User provides interview transcripts or recordings
- Multiple interviews need thematic synthesis
- Discovery requires structured qualitative evidence
- Cross-referencing interviews with other discovery sources

**Feel free to adapt or skip when**:
- Single interview insights can be captured directly in OST
- Narrative synthesis serves discovery goals better than structured format
- Time constraints favor direct insight extraction
- User prefers alternative synthesis approach

## Optional Structure (Adapt as Needed)

### Research Context

**Interview Objective**:
[What question were you trying to answer? What discovery goal drove these interviews?]

**Methodology**:
- **Date Range**: [When were interviews conducted?]
- **Interview Format**: [1:1, group, remote, in-person]
- **Duration**: [Avg. length per interview]
- **Interview Guide**: [Key questions asked, if structured]

**Participants**:
| Participant ID | Role/Persona | Company/Context | Date |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------|
| P1 | Senior PM | Enterprise SaaS, 500+ employees | 2026-01-15 |
| P2 | Product Lead | Startup, 10-50 employees | 2026-01-16 |
| [etc.] | | | |

**Sample Size & Representation**:
[How many participants? Do they represent target personas? Any sampling biases to note?]

---

### Key Themes

**Theme 1: [Theme Name]**
- **Definition**: [What is this theme about?]
- **Frequency**: [How many participants mentioned this? X/Y participants]
- **Verbatim Quotes**:
  > "Direct quote from participant" — P1, Senior PM

  > "Another supporting quote" — P3, Product Lead
- **Context**: [When/why does this theme surface? What triggers it?]

**Theme 2: [Theme Name]**
[Repeat structure]

**Theme 3: [Theme Name]**
[Continue for all major themes - typically 3-6 themes emerge]

---

### Pain Points

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Current Workaround | Impact if Unsolved |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [Specific pain] | High/Med/Low | X/Y participants | [How do they cope today?] | [Business/user impact] |
| [Specific pain] | High/Med/Low | X/Y participants | [Workaround] | [Impact] |

**Priority Pain Points** (Top 3):
1. **[Pain Point #1]**: [Why this is critical - quote + context]
2. **[Pain Point #2]**: [Evidence + impact]
3. **[Pain Point #3]**: [Evidence + impact]

---

### Insights & Opportunities

**Insight 1: [Discovery Insight]**
- **Evidence**: [Which theme(s)/quotes support this insight?]
- **Implication**: [What does this mean for product strategy?]
- **Potential Opportunity**: [How might we address this? Link to OST if generated]

**Insight 2: [Discovery Insight]**
[Repeat structure]

**Opportunity Mapping**:
```
[Optional: Show how insights map to opportunities]
Pain Point: [X] → Insight: [Y] → Opportunity: [Z - potential OST]
```

---

### Behavioral Patterns

**Workflow Observations**:
[How do users currently work? What patterns emerged across participants?]

**Tool Usage**:
[What tools do they use? Where do they switch context? What's manual vs. automated?]

**Decision-Making Process**:
[How do they make key decisions? What information do they need? Who's involved?]

---

### Divergent Perspectives

**Where Participants Disagreed**:
- **Topic**: [What was the disagreement about?]
- **Perspective A**: [X participants said...]
- **Perspective B**: [Y participants said...]
- **Hypothesis**: [Why might this divergence exist? Persona differences? Context?]

[Note: Disagreements often reveal important segmentation or contextual factors]

---

### Research Gaps & Follow-Up Questions

**What We Still Don't Know**:
- [ ] [Unanswered question from interviews]
- [ ] [Emerging question that needs validation]
- [ ] [Hypothesis that requires further research]

**Recommended Next Steps**:
- [ ] Validate [X insight] with quantitative analytics
- [ ] Interview [Y persona] to test divergent hypothesis
- [ ] Prototype [Z solution] for user testing

---

### Related Artifacts

**Informed By**:
- [Links to feedback synthesis, analytics, trends that provided context for these interviews]

**Informs**:
- [Links to OSTs, PRDs, prototypes that reference these interview insights]

**Cross-Reference**:
- See `execution/discovery/DISCOVERY_INDEX.md` for full research inventory (if maintaining index)

## Template Usage Tips

**Flexibility Reminders**:
- **Adapt section depth**: Brief summaries vs. comprehensive synthesis based on discovery needs
- **Combine with other templates**: Merge interview + feedback insights if sources overlap
- **Skip sections**: If behavioral patterns aren't relevant, remove that section
- **Custom sections**: Add sections that serve your discovery goals (e.g., "Jobs to Be Done", "Emotional Responses")

**Quality Over Format**:
- Structured format is helpful, but quality insights matter more than template adherence
- 3 high-impact insights > 10 low-quality themes
- Direct quotes are powerful - use liberally to bring user voice into artifacts

**Evidence-Based Discovery**:
- Always cite participant IDs for traceability
- Note frequency to distinguish widespread vs. outlier feedback
- Connect insights to actionable opportunities (OSTs, PRDs)
