# PM OS - Claude Code Project Context

**Project Name**: Product Management Operating System (PM OS)
**Version**: Phase 5 (Claude Code Skills Migration)
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Updated**: 2026-02-14
**Status**: Active Development

---

## Project Overview

PM OS is a self-improving product management system that uses Claude Code, a full MCP integration suite, and multi-agent architecture to augment product managers into AI-powered product leaders.

### Vision
To transform Product Managers from document-authors into high-leverage Strategic Architects. The PM OS uses AI to bridge the gap between customer empathy, technical feasibility, and business impact—amplifying strategic judgment over administrative output.

### Mission
Institutionalize product strategy, discovery, and execution as executable code that improves itself over time.

### North Star Metrics (Flexible Framework)

Organizations choose 3-4 metrics that fit their context. Options include:

**Time Efficiency**: 50% PRD time reduction (8h → 4h) OR 80% Time-to-Spec reduction (< 4h)
**Quality & Rework**: 40% rework reduction (40% → 10%) OR > 95% Sprint Readiness (zero clarifications)
**Discovery & Validation**: 4x discovery artifacts (2 → 8/week) OR 2x Hypothesis-to-Halt velocity
**Strategic Alignment**: 100% Identity Traceability (all artifacts cite vision/mission/roadmap)

See `identity/STRATEGY.md` for detailed metric definitions and recommended sets for different team maturity levels.

## Key Architecture Components

### Identity Layer (Organizational Context)
The Identity Layer stores YOUR organizational intelligence that agents use for decision-making:

**YOUR Organizational Context** (in `identity/` - customize these templates!):
- **`identity/STRATEGY.md`**: YOUR company vision, mission, North Star metrics (template - replace with YOUR actual strategy!)
- **`identity/STANDARDS.md`**: YOUR brand voice, tech stack, security requirements (template - replace with YOUR actual standards!)
- **`identity/ROADMAP.md`**: YOUR product roadmap (template - replace with YOUR actual roadmap!)
- **`identity/README.md`**: Customization guide with step-by-step instructions

**PM OS's Own Context** (in `pm-os-reference/identity/` - reference examples, read-only):
- **`pm-os-reference/identity/STRATEGY.md`**: PM OS's vision, mission, NSM (reference example)
- **`pm-os-reference/identity/STANDARDS.md`**: PM OS's brand voice, tech stack (reference example)
- **`pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md`**: PM OS's Phase 0-7 implementation timeline (reference example)
- **`pm-os-reference/identity/README.md`**: Explains PM OS's meta-recursive organizational context

**CRITICAL**: Agents load files from `identity/` (YOUR context), NOT from `pm-os-reference/identity/` (PM OS's reference examples). Users must customize `identity/` templates with THEIR actual organizational information.

**Usage**: All agents automatically load relevant identity context from `identity/` before generating outputs.

### Agent Architecture

**Orchestrator Agent**:
- **Role**: Master router for all tasks
- **File**: `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` (deep routing reference), this file (CLAUDE.md) serves as the ambient orchestration layer
- **Capabilities**: Task routing, context injection, security enforcement, workflow management

**Specialist Agents** (Progressive implementation):
- **Product Architect** (Phase 0-1): Discovery, OSTs, PRD generation, agent spec creation
- **Engineering Partner** (Phase 1): Technical feasibility, BPMN modeling, API specs
- **UX Strategist** (Phase 1): Information architecture, React/Tailwind prototypes
- **Data Analyst** (Phase 2): SQL queries, metrics validation, A/B test analysis
- **GTM Strategist** (Phase 2): Value propositions, positioning, sales enablement
- **System Evaluator** (Phase 3): Meta-agent for quality audits and self-improvement proposals

### Templates

All artifacts follow standardized templates stored in `templates/`:

- **`agent_spec_template.md`**: Format for defining new agents
- **`prd_template.md`**: BMAD-compliant PRD structure (Business, Metrics, Approach, Details)
- **`mcp_integration_plan.md`**: Standard setup guide for MCP services

### Execution Layer (Version-Controlled Outputs)

**User Workspace**: Artifacts are stored in `execution/` with version control:

- `execution/discovery/`: Opportunity Solution Trees, user research, IA maps
- `execution/prds/`: Product requirements documents
- `execution/technical_specs/`: BPMN models, API contracts, Gherkin scenarios
- `execution/prototypes/`: React/Tailwind components
- `execution/gtm/`: Value propositions, battle cards, positioning docs
- `execution/automation/`: (Phase 5) Deployment scripts, reporting cron jobs

**Naming Convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD_[artifact-type]_[brief-title].md`

**Examples**: PM OS inception materials (showing the system building itself) are in `pm-os-reference/`:
- `pm-os-reference/artifacts/`: PM OS discovery, PRDs, specs, prototypes from Phase 0-1
- `pm-os-reference/documentation/`: Validation reports, phase history, changelogs, research

### MCP Integration Suite

PM OS integrates external tools via Model Context Protocol using official providers:

**Phase 1** ✅: Google Drive (legacy document retrieval) - Operational
**Phase 4** ✅: Atlassian Rovo MCP (2026-02-03) - **Active**
- **Jira**: Issue tracking, epic/story creation, JQL search (natural language interface)
- **Confluence**: Documentation publishing, page creation, search (natural language interface)
- **Authentication**: Automatic OAuth 2.1 via browser (zero manual token management)
- **Endpoint**: `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` via `npx mcp-remote`
- **Setup Guide**: `mcp/setup_guides/ROVO_MCP_SETUP.md`

**Strategic Decision**: Migrated from custom MCP server to Atlassian's official Rovo MCP Server
- ✅ Eliminates OAuth 2.0 token refresh issues
- ✅ Automatic permission inheritance from Jira/Confluence
- ✅ Zero maintenance (Atlassian-managed)
- ✅ Enterprise security and audit logging
- ✅ Free during beta period

**Future MCPs** (Phase 5-7):
- Slack (team communication) - Phase 7-8
- Snowflake (data warehouse) - Phase 5
- Linear, Notion (under evaluation)

**Configuration**: `.mcp.json` (project-scoped, version controlled)

## Workflow Patterns

### Standard Task Routing (Orchestrator Logic)

When you receive a user request in Claude Code:

1. **Identify Task Type**:
   - Discovery (OST, user research) → Product Architect
   - Technical (API, architecture) → Engineering Partner
   - UI/UX (wireframes, prototypes) → UX Strategist
   - Data (SQL, analytics) → Data Analyst
   - GTM (positioning, value prop) → GTM Strategist
   - Quality audit → System Evaluator

2. **Load Identity Context**:
   - Always: `identity/STRATEGY.md` (USER's strategy), `identity/STANDARDS.md` (USER's standards)
   - For PM OS meta-tasks: `pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md` (PM OS's implementation timeline)
   - For user's product work: `identity/ROADMAP.md` (USER's product roadmap)
   - Conditionally: `identity/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` (Future Phase 5)

3. **Apply Quality Standards**:
   - Check output follows `identity/STANDARDS.md` brand voice
   - Verify technical stack matches approved technologies
   - Ensure security requirements met
   - Validate artifact structure matches relevant template

4. **Execute or Route**:
   - For tasks within Claude Code capabilities (deep analysis, file operations): Execute directly
   - For tasks requiring specific agent: Explain which agent would handle this in full implementation
   - For complex workflows: Outline multi-agent sequence

### End-to-End Feature Development Workflow

```
User Request
  ↓
Product Architect: Generate OST + Initial PRD
  ↓
Engineering Partner: Technical Feasibility Review
  ↓
UX Strategist: Prototype + Information Architecture
  ↓
Data Analyst: Validate Metrics
  ↓
GTM Strategist: Positioning + Value Proposition
  ↓
Product Architect: Consolidate into Final PRD
  ↓
Human PM Review & Approval
```

**Parallel Processing Opportunities**:
- UX Strategist + Engineering Partner (after initial PRD)
- Data Analyst + GTM Strategist (both use PRD independently)

---

## Security & Quality Standards

### Security Non-Negotiables (from `identity/STANDARDS.md`)

1. **No hardcoded secrets**: All credentials in `.env` (gitignored)
2. **OAuth 2.0 required**: For all MCP integrations with user data
3. **Read-only by default**: Write permissions require explicit justification
4. **PII redaction**: Automatically redact sensitive data in logs/outputs
5. **Pre-commit scanning**: Git hooks scan for accidentally committed secrets

### Quality Gates (Before Agent Output Approval)

- [ ] Aligns with `identity/STRATEGY.md` vision
- [ ] Follows brand voice from `identity/STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Includes specific metrics/acceptance criteria
- [ ] Cites evidence for key decisions
- [ ] Free of security vulnerabilities (no SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- [ ] Technical stack matches approved technologies

## How to Use PM OS in Claude Code

### For Discovery Tasks

**Example**: "Generate an OST for improving user onboarding"

**Process**:
1. Load `identity/STRATEGY.md` to check strategic alignment
2. Generate Opportunity Solution Tree in Mermaid format
3. Save to `execution/discovery/YYYY-MM-DD_OST_[brief-title].md`
4. Follow structure from any existing OST examples or best practices

### For PRD Generation

**Example**: "Create a PRD for collaborative editing feature"

**Process**:
1. Load `identity/STRATEGY.md` (vision alignment) and `identity/STANDARDS.md` (quality standards)
2. Use `templates/prd_template.md` as structure
3. Follow BMAD method (Business case, Metrics, Approach, Details)
4. Save to `execution/prds/YYYY-MM-DD_PRD_[brief-title].md`
5. Ensure includes: problem statement, success metrics, user stories with Gherkin scenarios

### For Technical Specifications

**Example**: "Design API for real-time sync"

**Process**:
1. Load `identity/STANDARDS.md` (approved tech stack: React, Node.js, TypeScript)
2. Generate OpenAPI specification
3. Create BPMN diagram for complex workflows (if applicable)
4. Write Gherkin acceptance scenarios
5. Include security review checklist
6. Save to `execution/technical_specs/YYYY-MM-DD_TechSpec_[brief-title].md`

### For PM OS Self-Improvement

**Example**: "Add a new agent for handling payments domain"

**Process**:
1. Check `pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md` to ensure PM OS's current phase supports new agents
2. Use `templates/agent_spec_template.md` as foundation
3. Generate `.claude/agents/[agent-name].md` (and optionally `.claude/commands/[name].md` for user-facing entry point)
4. Update Orchestrator routing logic in `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` to recognize payments-related keywords
5. Propose changes as documented enhancement for human review

## Common Commands & Patterns

### Reading Identity Context

Before any substantive task:
```
Read identity/STRATEGY.md and identity/STANDARDS.md to understand USER's organizational context
```

For PM OS meta-tasks (improving PM OS itself):
```
Read pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md to check PM OS's current phase status
```

### Generating Artifacts

Always use templates:
```
Use templates/prd_template.md as structure for this PRD
Save to execution/prds/2026-01-31_PRD_[feature-name].md
```

### Checking Current Phase

To understand what's in scope for PM OS development:
```
Read pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md to check PM OS's current phase status
Verify this task aligns with Phase [N] objectives for PM OS implementation
```

To understand user's product roadmap:
```
Read identity/ROADMAP.md to check USER's product roadmap
Verify feature aligns with USER's strategic timeline
```

### Validating Outputs

Before finalizing any artifact:
```
Validate against identity/STANDARDS.md quality gates:
- Professional, technical, concise writing
- Evidence-based decisions
- Approved tech stack
- Security requirements met
```

## Key Principles for Claude Code Usage

### 1. Deep Analysis Mode
Use Claude Code for:
- Comprehensive codebase exploration (read multiple files, understand architecture)
- Complex multi-step workflows requiring extensive context
- Terminal operations (git, deployment scripts)
- Parallel agent processing (spawn multiple analysis tasks)

### 2. Context Preservation
- Maintain session state across multi-turn conversations
- Link related artifacts (OST → PRD → Tech Spec)
- Carry forward key decisions between workflow steps

### 3. Self-Awareness
- PM OS is building itself (meta-recursive)
- When working on PM OS improvements, consult `pm-os-reference/identity/ROADMAP.md` (PM OS's implementation phases)
- When working on user's product features, consult `identity/ROADMAP.md` (user's product roadmap)
- Propose enhancements aligned with current phase

### 4. Quality Over Speed
- Always validate against `identity/STANDARDS.md`
- Include evidence and reasoning
- Flag uncertainties for human review
- Don't skip security checks
