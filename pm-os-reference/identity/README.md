# PM OS's Own Organizational Context (Meta-Recursive)

This directory contains **PM OS's own organizational intelligence** - the actual strategy, roadmap, and standards that govern how PM OS builds and improves itself.

**Purpose**: These files serve as:
1. **Reference examples**: Show what a complete Identity Layer looks like
2. **PM OS meta-documentation**: The organizational context PM OS uses to build itself (meta-recursive)
3. **Structural templates**: Demonstrate how to structure YOUR own identity files

**Important**: These are **PM OS's own files**, not templates for customization. For templates to customize with YOUR company's information, see `identity/` directory.

## What's Here

### `STRATEGY.md` - PM OS's Vision, Mission, and North Star Metrics

**PM OS's Vision**: "To transform Product Managers from document-authors into high-leverage Strategic Architects."

**PM OS's Mission**: "Institutionalize product strategy, discovery, and execution as executable code that improves itself over time."

**PM OS's North Star Metrics**: Flexible framework emphasizing time efficiency, quality, discovery velocity, and strategic alignment.

**How to use this file**:
- **As reference**: See how PM OS defines its own strategic context
- **As structural example**: Use similar sections (Vision, Mission, NSM, Strategic Principles) in YOUR `identity/STRATEGY.md`
- **Don't edit**: This is PM OS's actual strategy for building itself - keep as read-only reference

---

### `ROADMAP.md` - PM OS Implementation Phases (Phase 0-7)

**PM OS's Roadmap**: 7-phase implementation timeline describing how PM OS builds itself:
- Phase 0: Bootstrap Foundation ✅
- Phase 1: Core Agent Team + Google Drive MCP ✅
- Phase 2: Execution Layer (5-Agent Team) ✅
- Phase 3: Self-Improvement Loop (In Progress)
- Phase 4-7: MCP Integration, Data Intelligence, IDE Optimization, Enterprise Readiness

**How to use this file**:
- **As reference**: Understand PM OS's development timeline and current phase
- **As structural example**: See how to organize a phase-based or theme-based roadmap
- **Don't confuse with YOUR roadmap**: This describes PM OS building itself; YOUR `identity/ROADMAP.md` should describe YOUR product's roadmap

---

### `STANDARDS.md` - PM OS Quality Standards and Tech Stack

**PM OS's Standards**: Brand voice (professional, technical, concise), tech stack (React, TypeScript, Node.js), security requirements (OAuth 2.0, no hardcoded secrets), quality gates (strategic alignment, evidence-based decisions).

**How to use this file**:
- **As reference**: See comprehensive example of organizational standards
- **As structural example**: Use similar sections (Brand Voice, Technical Stack, Security, Quality Gates) in YOUR `identity/STANDARDS.md`
- **Adapt to YOUR context**: Replace PM OS's tech stack with YOUR tech stack, PM OS's brand voice with YOUR brand voice

## How This Relates to YOUR `identity/` Directory

### Clear Distinction

**pm-os-reference/identity/** (this directory):
- Contains PM OS's **own** organizational context
- Files are **reference examples** - read-only, don't edit
- Shows PM OS building itself (meta-recursive)

**identity/** (your customization directory):
- Contains **templates** for YOUR company's organizational context
- Files have **"🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS"** headers - you should edit these
- Shows YOUR strategy, YOUR roadmap, YOUR standards that agents use for YOUR work

### Analogy

Think of it like:
- **pm-os-reference/identity/**: PM OS's own resume/company handbook (reference only)
- **identity/**: YOUR resume/company handbook (customize with your info)

Just like you wouldn't edit someone else's resume, you shouldn't edit `pm-os-reference/identity/` files. Instead, use them as structural inspiration for customizing YOUR `identity/` files.

## Meta-Recursive Development

PM OS practices what it preaches:

**PM OS has its own Identity Layer** (this directory):
- **STRATEGY.md**: PM OS's vision to transform PMs into Strategic Architects
- **ROADMAP.md**: PM OS's 7-phase implementation timeline
- **STANDARDS.md**: PM OS's quality standards and tech stack

**PM OS agents reference these files** when working on PM OS improvements:
- Product Architect checks Phase 3 objectives when proposing self-improvement features
- Engineering Partner validates technical decisions against PM OS's approved stack (React, TypeScript)
- System Evaluator audits outputs against PM OS's quality standards

**This proves PM OS works**: If PM OS can successfully build and improve itself using its own agents and Identity Layer, it can do the same for your products.

## Customization Guide (For YOUR Identity Files)

**Don't edit files in this directory.** Instead:

1. **Navigate to `identity/` directory** (parent directory)
2. **Open template files** with "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" headers:
   - `identity/STRATEGY.md` - Replace with YOUR company's vision/mission
   - `identity/ROADMAP.md` - Replace with YOUR product's roadmap
   - `identity/STANDARDS.md` - Replace with YOUR tech stack/standards
3. **Use pm-os-reference/identity/ files as reference** for structure and content examples
4. **Follow customization instructions** in each template file
5. **Read identity/README.md** for detailed customization guidance

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Should I edit STRATEGY.md in this directory or in `identity/`?**
A: **Never edit files in pm-os-reference/identity/**. Edit `identity/STRATEGY.md` (the template with "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" header).

**Q: Why do pm-os-reference/identity/ and identity/ have the same filenames?**
A: To show the parallel structure. PM OS has its own organizational context (pm-os-reference/identity/), and YOU have yours (identity/). Same file structure, different content.

**Q: Can I delete pm-os-reference/identity/ if I don't need the reference?**
A: You can, but we recommend keeping it as a reference example of a complete Identity Layer. It's also useful for understanding PM OS's development roadmap.

**Q: How do I know if I'm looking at PM OS's files or my customization templates?**
A:
- **pm-os-reference/identity/**: PM OS's own files (no "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" header, read-only reference)
- **identity/**: YOUR templates (prominent "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" header, you should edit these)
