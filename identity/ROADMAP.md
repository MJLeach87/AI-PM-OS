# 🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS: Your Product Roadmap

**IMPORTANT**: This is for YOUR product's roadmap, not PM OS's implementation phases.

**Reference**: See `examples/identity/ROADMAP.md` for PM OS's own roadmap (Phase 0-7 timeline) as a structural example only. That file describes how PM OS builds itself; THIS file should describe YOUR product's roadmap.

**Purpose**: This file contains YOUR product roadmap that PM OS agents will reference to ensure new features align with your product strategy and timeline.

**Customization Instructions**:
1. Choose a roadmap structure that fits your team's planning approach
2. Replace all `[placeholders]` with your actual product initiatives
3. Keep this file updated as your roadmap evolves (typically monthly or quarterly)
4. Link to Jira/Linear epics if your team uses those tools

**How Agents Use This File**:
- Product Architect checks new feature proposals against your roadmap for alignment
- Engineering Partner references planned initiatives when assessing technical feasibility
- GTM Strategist aligns positioning with upcoming features
- All agents ensure new work supports your strategic timeline

**Flexibility**: PM OS doesn't enforce a specific roadmap format. Use whatever structure works for your team.

**Need Help?** See `identity/README.md` for detailed customization guidance.
