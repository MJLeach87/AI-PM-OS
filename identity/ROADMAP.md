# PM OS Roadmap

## Meta-Recursive Note
This roadmap describes how PM OS will build itself. It is maintained by the Product Architect agent and updated as phases complete.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 0: Bootstrap Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration**: Weeks 1-2
**Status**: Complete
**Completion**: 100%

**Objective**: Create minimal viable structure enabling self-improvement

**Critical Deliverables**:
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Identity Layer (STRATEGY.md, STANDARDS.md, ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Orchestrator agent (.cursor and .claude versions)
- [x] Product Architect agent (.cursor and .claude versions)
- [x] Agent specification template
- [x] PRD template (BMAD-compliant)
- [x] MCP integration plan template
- [x] Git configuration (.gitignore, .env.example)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Orchestrator routes tasks to Product Architect
- [ ] Product Architect generates valid Opportunity Solution Trees
- [ ] Product Architect generates agent specifications using template
- [ ] Identity Layer loaded into agent context automatically
- [ ] PM OS articulates its own Phase 1 plan

**First Test**: Ask Product Architect to "Generate OST for improving PM OS discovery workflows"

### Phase 1: Core Agent Team + Google Drive MCP ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration**: Weeks 3-5
**Status**: Complete
**Completion**: 100%

**Objective**: Establish specialized agent team and unlock legacy documents

**Agent Implementation Sequence**:
1. **Engineering Partner v1.1** (Week 3) - ✅ Complete (with legacy code analysis)
2. **UX Strategist v1.0** (Week 4) - ✅ Complete
3. **Google Drive MCP** (Week 5) - ✅ Complete (OAuth setup, 514ms latency)

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] 3 specialized agents operational in both Cursor and Claude Code
- [x] Google Drive MCP retrieves documents in < 3 seconds (achieved 514ms)
- [x] End-to-end workflow: Discovery → Feasibility → Prototype (validated 2026-02-01)
- [x] First complete artifact set generated (Artifact Search Filter - 6 deliverables)

**Workflow Test**: Generate feature proposal end-to-end (OST → PRD → Tech Spec → Prototype)

---

### Phase 2: Execution Layer + Jira/Confluence MCP
**Duration**: Weeks 6-8
**Status**: Planned
**Completion**: 0%

**Objective**: Establish artifact generation pipelines and dev workflow integration for core product lifecycle tools

**Key Deliverables**:
- Artifact generation workflows (discovery, PRDs, tech specs, prototypes, GTM)
- Data Analyst agent (Week 6) - Generated BY Engineering Partner
- **Jira MCP integration** (Week 7) - Bi-directional issue sync, story creation
- **Confluence MCP integration** (Week 7) - Documentation publishing, wiki search
- GTM Strategist agent (Week 8) - Generated BY Product Arch + Data Analyst

**Rationale**: Jira + Confluence are core Atlassian products for product development lifecycle (dev workflow + documentation)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 5 core agents operational
- [ ] Jira MCP creates/reads issues programmatically
- [ ] Confluence MCP publishes PRDs and retrieves existing documentation
- [ ] Complete artifact pipeline: Discovery → PRD → Tech Spec → Prototype → Stories → GTM
- [ ] PM OS generates its own Phase 3 implementation tickets in Jira
- [ ] First PRD published to Confluence automatically

---

### Phase 3: Communication Layer + Self-Improvement
**Duration**: Weeks 9-11
**Status**: Planned
**Completion**: 0%

**Objective**: Enable team communication integration and implement self-improvement loop

**Key Deliverables**:
- Slack MCP integration (Week 9) - Historical context, notifications, daily digests
- System Evaluator agent (Week 10-11) - Meta-agent for quality audits
- Orchestrator routing intelligence enhancement
- Self-improvement proposal automation

**Self-Improvement Loop**:
1. Agents generate outputs
2. System Evaluator analyzes weekly
3. Improvement proposals created as PRs
4. Human reviews and approves
5. Approved changes merged → agents updated

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Slack MCP operational (retrieve historical context, post notifications)
- [ ] First self-improvement cycle completed (proposal → approval → update)
- [ ] Orchestrator routing accuracy > 95%
- [ ] Automated daily digest posted to Slack
- [ ] System Evaluator identifies at least 3 improvement opportunities

---

### Phase 4: Data Intelligence Layer
**Duration**: Weeks 12-14
**Status**: Planned
**Completion**: 0%

**Objective**: Integrate data warehouse for insights-driven product development

**Key Deliverables**:
- Snowflake MCP integration with read-only role (Week 12)
- Data Analyst enhancement for Snowflake optimization (Week 13)
- DATA_DICTIONARY.md in identity layer (Week 14)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Snowflake MCP executes queries in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Data Analyst produces actionable insights
- [ ] First data-validated feature proposal completed
- [ ] DATA_DICTIONARY.md maintained as single source of truth

---

### Phase 5: Hybrid IDE Optimization
**Duration**: Weeks 15-17
**Status**: Planned
**Completion**: 0%

**Objective**: Optimize for Cursor and Claude Code specific capabilities

**Cursor-Specific Features**:
- Plan Mode integration for Discovery workflows
- Integrated browser prototyping with live React previews

**Claude Code-Specific Features**:
- Parallel agent processing (spawn 3+ agents simultaneously)
- Custom domain specialist sub-agents
- Terminal automation for deployment/reporting

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Cursor Plan Mode generates valid implementation plans
- [ ] Claude Code parallel processing reduces review time by 60%
- [ ] First domain specialist operational
- [ ] 5+ automated workflows running

---

### Phase 6: Enterprise Readiness
**Duration**: Weeks 18-24
**Status**: Planned
**Completion**: 0%

**Objective**: Prepare for multi-user collaboration and production deployment

**Key Deliverables**:
- Multi-user Git workflow with CODEOWNERS (Weeks 18-19)
- Security hardening and SOC 2 readiness (Week 20)
- Onboarding documentation and training (Week 21)
- Web application prototype (Optional - Weeks 22-24)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 5+ PMs using PM OS concurrently
- [ ] Zero security incidents
- [ ] Onboarding time < 2 hours
- [ ] Web prototype demonstrates PRD generation feature parity

---

### Future Phase Considerations

**MCP Integrations Under Evaluation**:
- **Linear**: Alternative to Jira for teams using Linear (deferred from Phase 2)
- **Notion**: Corporate wiki integration (deferred from Phase 3)

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- Jira + Confluence cover core Atlassian ecosystem (most common enterprise stack)
- Linear integration can be added if team uses Linear instead of Jira
- Notion integration deferred in favor of Confluence (Atlassian alignment)
- Future phases can add these based on user demand and team stack preferences

## Dependency Chain

```
Phase 0 (Bootstrap)
    ↓
Phase 1 (Core Agents + Google Drive)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Execution Layer + Jira/Confluence) ← Atlassian ecosystem integration
    ↓
Phase 3 (Communication + Self-Improvement) ← Critical for long-term success
    ↓
Phase 4 (Data Intelligence)
    ↓
Phase 5 (IDE Optimization)
    ↓
Phase 6 (Enterprise Readiness)
    ↓
Future (Linear, Notion - as needed)
```

## Self-Build Maturity Targets

| Phase | Agent-Generated Work | Human Work |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| 0-1   | 20%                 | 80%        |
| 2     | 40%                 | 60%        |
| 3     | 70%                 | 30%        |
| 4-6   | 85%                 | 15%        |

## Risk Mitigation Tracking

### Active Risks (Phase 0)
- **MCP credential leakage**: Mitigated with .gitignore + pre-commit hooks
- **Agent prompt drift**: Will be mitigated in Phase 3 with System Evaluator
- **Context overflow**: Using identity/ sharding strategy

### Future Risks to Monitor
- Cross-IDE compatibility breaks (Phase 5)
- Multi-user merge conflicts (Phase 6)
- Identity Layer staleness (ongoing)
