# 🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS: Your Company's Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: This is a template. Replace all PM OS default content below with YOUR company's actual vision, mission, and North Star Metrics.

**Reference**: See `examples/identity/STRATEGY.md` for PM OS's own strategy as an example of what this file should contain.

**Purpose**: This file contains YOUR organizational strategy that PM OS agents will use to ensure all product decisions align with your company's vision and goals.

## Vision

**[Replace with YOUR company's vision statement]**

Example: "To transform [your industry] by [your unique value proposition]"

---

## Mission

**[Replace with YOUR product team's mission]**

Example: "Deliver [specific outcomes] that enable [target users] to [achieve specific goals]"

---

## North Star Metrics

**Philosophy**: Choose 3-4 metrics from the framework below that fit YOUR organization's context and maturity level.

### Metric Framework (Choose 3-4 Metrics)

Organizations can select metrics from these categories based on their priorities:

#### A. Time Efficiency Metrics
- **50% Reduction in PRD Drafting Time** (8h → 4h) - Volume-based baseline
- **80% Reduction in "Time-to-Spec"** (< 4h from hypothesis to dev-ready spec) - Velocity-focused

#### B. Quality & Rework Metrics
- **40% Reduction in Engineering Rework** (40% → 10% of PRDs requiring major edits)
- **"Zero-Clarification" Sprint Readiness** (> 95% of PRDs pass sprint planning without technical edits)

#### C. Discovery & Validation Metrics
- **4x Increase in Discovery Artifacts** (2 → 8 per week) - Output volume
- **2x "Hypothesis-to-Halt" Velocity** (1-week cycles to prove ideas unviable)

#### D. Strategic Alignment Metrics
- **100% Identity Traceability** (Every artifact explicitly cites vision/mission connection) - Recommended for all teams
- **Strategic Alignment Score** (% of artifacts advancing at least one NSM)

### Your Selected Metrics

**[List YOUR 3-4 chosen metrics here with specific targets for YOUR organization]**

Example:
1. 80% Reduction in Time-to-Spec (< 4h)
2. Zero-Clarification Sprint Readiness (> 95%)
3. 2x Hypothesis-to-Halt Velocity
4. 100% Identity Traceability

## Strategic Principles

**[Define YOUR organization's strategic principles]**

Examples:
1. **Customer-First**: All decisions prioritize user value over internal convenience
2. **Data-Driven**: Product hypotheses validated with quantitative and qualitative evidence
3. **Iterative Development**: Ship MVPs quickly, iterate based on feedback
4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Product, Engineering, Design work together from day 1

## Current Phase / Focus

**[Describe YOUR product team's current strategic focus]**

Example: "Q1 2026: Focus on enterprise customer acquisition through security and compliance features"

---

## Success Definition

**[Define what success looks like for YOUR product/organization]**

Example:
- Product managers spend 80% of time on strategy, 20% on documentation
- Engineering teams receive complete, feasible specifications consistently
- Product decisions are traceable, data-informed, and aligned with company vision
- New product capabilities ship with 90% fewer specification-related delays

---

## Long-Term Vision Timeline

**[Optional: YOUR product roadmap timeline]**

Example:
- **Q2 2026**: Launch feature X to capture market segment Y
- **Q3 2026**: Achieve Z% market share in target vertical
- **Q4 2026**: Expand to international markets
