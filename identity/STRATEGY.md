# PM OS Strategy

## Vision
Augment Product Managers into AI-powered product leaders who deliver higher-quality outcomes in a fraction of the time.

## Mission
Institutionalize product strategy, discovery, and execution as executable code that improves itself over time.

## North Star Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics
- **50% reduction in PRD drafting time** (from 8 hours to 2 hours)
- **40% reduction in engineering rework** (from 40% to 10% of PRDs requiring major edits)
- **4x increase in discovery artifacts** (from 2 to 8 per week)

### Secondary Success Metrics
- **Onboarding acceleration**: From 2 weeks to 2 hours for new PMs
- **Stakeholder satisfaction**: From 3.2/5 to 4.5/5 on post-artifact surveys
- **Technical feasibility**: From 60% to 90% of features built as originally specified

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Self-Improvement First
The PM OS must be capable of building and improving itself. By Phase 3, the system generates 70% of its own improvements.

### 2. Context as Code
Organizational intelligence (vision, standards, market positioning) is version-controlled and automatically injected into agent context.

### 3. Hybrid Intelligence
Combine AI automation with human strategic oversight. Agents generate, humans approve and refine.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Start minimal (Phase 0 bootstrap) → self-building (Phases 1-2) → self-improving (Phase 3) → enterprise-ready (Phases 4-6).

### 5. Multi-Environment Design
Optimize for both Cursor IDE (real-time collaboration) and Claude Code (deep analysis) environments.

## Current Phase
**Phase 0: Bootstrap Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)

## Success Definition
PM OS is successful when:
- Product managers spend 80% of time on strategy, 20% on documentation (reversed from current state)
- Engineering teams receive complete, feasible specifications consistently
- Product decisions are traceable, data-informed, and aligned with company vision
- New product capabilities ship with 90% fewer specification-related delays

## Long-Term Vision Timeline
- **Month 6**: Full team onboarded, web prototype operational
- **Month 12**: Web application replaces IDE for 80% of use cases
- **Month 18**: PM OS as potential revenue-generating SaaS (if commercializing)
- **Self-Build Maturity**: 90% of new features PM OS-generated by end of implementation
