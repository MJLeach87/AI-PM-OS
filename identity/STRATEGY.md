# PM OS Strategy

## Vision
To transform Product Managers from document-authors into high-leverage Strategic Architects. The PM OS uses AI to bridge the gap between customer empathy, technical feasibility, and business impact—amplifying strategic judgment over administrative output.

## Mission
Institutionalize product strategy, discovery, and execution as executable code that improves itself over time.

## North Star Metrics

**Philosophy**: Balance "Volume of Output" with "Quality of Outcome" and "Strategic Velocity" - teams choose metrics that fit their context.

### Metric Framework (Choose 3-4 Metrics)

Organizations can select metrics from these categories based on their maturity and priorities:

#### A. Time Efficiency Metrics
- **50% Reduction in PRD Drafting Time** (8h → 4h) - *Volume-based baseline*
- **80% Reduction in "Time-to-Spec"** (< 4h from hypothesis to dev-ready spec) - *Velocity-focused*

#### B. Quality & Rework Metrics
- **40% Reduction in Engineering Rework** (40% → 10% of PRDs requiring major edits) - *Original metric*
- **"Zero-Clarification" Sprint Readiness** (> 95% of PRDs pass sprint planning without technical edits) - *Quality-focused*

#### C. Discovery & Validation Metrics
- **4x Increase in Discovery Artifacts** (2 → 8 per week) - *Output volume*
- **2x "Hypothesis-to-Halt" Velocity** (1-week cycles to prove ideas unviable) - *Validation speed*

#### D. Strategic Alignment Metrics
- **100% Identity Traceability** (Every artifact explicitly cites vision/mission connection) - *Mandatory*
- **Strategic Alignment Score** (% of artifacts advancing at least one NSM) - *Compliance tracking*

### Recommended Metric Sets

**For Early-Stage Teams** (Focus on establishing baseline):
- 50% Reduction in PRD Drafting Time
- 40% Reduction in Engineering Rework
- 4x Increase in Discovery Artifacts
- 100% Identity Traceability

**For Mature Teams** (Focus on velocity + quality):
- 80% Reduction in Time-to-Spec
- "Zero-Clarification" Sprint Readiness (> 95%)
- 2x Hypothesis-to-Halt Velocity
- 100% Identity Traceability

**Blended Approach** (Mix of volume + quality):
- 50-80% Reduction in Time-to-Spec (< 4h)
- Choose: Rework % OR Sprint Readiness
- 2-4x Discovery Output Velocity
- 100% Identity Traceability

### Phase 0-1 Baseline (Historical Reference)
Phase 0-1 used volume-based metrics as foundation:
- 50% reduction in PRD drafting time (8h → 2h)
- 40% reduction in engineering rework (40% → 10%)
- 4x increase in discovery artifacts (2 → 8/week)

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Self-Improvement First
The PM OS must be capable of building and improving itself. By Phase 3, the system generates 70% of its own improvements.

### 2. Context as Code
Organizational intelligence (vision, standards, market positioning) is version-controlled and automatically injected into agent context.

### 3. Hybrid Intelligence
Combine AI automation with human strategic oversight. Agents generate, humans approve and refine.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Start minimal (Phase 0 bootstrap) → self-building (Phases 1-2) → self-improving (Phase 3) → enterprise-ready (Phases 4-6).

### 5. Multi-Environment Design
Optimize for both Cursor IDE (real-time collaboration) and Claude Code (deep analysis) environments.

## Current Phase
**Phase 0: Bootstrap Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)

## Success Definition
PM OS is successful when:
- Product managers spend 80% of time on strategy, 20% on documentation (reversed from current state)
- Engineering teams receive complete, feasible specifications consistently
- Product decisions are traceable, data-informed, and aligned with company vision
- New product capabilities ship with 90% fewer specification-related delays

## Long-Term Vision Timeline
- **Month 6**: Full team onboarded, web prototype operational
- **Month 12**: Web application replaces IDE for 80% of use cases
- **Month 18**: PM OS as potential revenue-generating SaaS (if commercializing)
- **Self-Build Maturity**: 90% of new features PM OS-generated by end of implementation
