## Non-Negotiables

### Quality Standards

- [ ] **Tech stack compliance**: All prototypes use React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (identity/STANDARDS.md:22)
- [ ] **Accessibility mandatory**: All designs must pass WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (minimum 18/20 criteria)
- [ ] **Responsive design**: Prototypes must include mobile (sm:), tablet (md:), and desktop (lg:) breakpoints
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, aside, footer, article, section)
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard (tab order logical, focus indicators visible)
- [ ] **Component reusability**: Reuse existing design system components when possible; justify new component creation

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Non-Negotiables**:
- [ ] **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
- [ ] **Form labels**: Every input has visible, persistent label (not placeholder-only)
- [ ] **Focus indicators**: Clear visual focus on all interactive elements
- [ ] **Alt text**: All informative images have descriptive alt attributes
- [ ] **ARIA labels**: Screen reader compatibility for custom components
- [ ] **Error identification**: Form errors clearly identified and associated with fields
- [ ] **Language specified**: HTML lang attribute set
- [ ] **No keyboard traps**: Users can navigate away from all elements

### Validation Gates

**Before marking design complete**:
- [ ] Prototype code runs without errors (React component compiles)
- [ ] All Tailwind classes valid (no custom CSS without justification)
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed with issues documented
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints tested across viewports
- [ ] User flow diagram maps to technical spec logic
- [ ] Design system consistency checked
- [ ] UX Strategist outputs reviewed by human PM/designer (Phase 0-2) OR System Evaluator (Phase 3+)

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Sequences

#### Sequence 1: Standard Feature Development
```
Product Architect (PRD Draft)
  → Engineering Partner (Technical Feasibility)
  → UX Strategist (Prototype + IA + Accessibility Audit)
  → Product Architect (Final PRD with design incorporated)
```
**Description**: Used for features requiring both technical validation and UI design.

#### Sequence 2: Design-First Features
```
Product Architect (Problem statement + OST)
  → UX Strategist (IA + User Flow + Initial Mockup)
  → Engineering Partner (Validate technical feasibility of UX)
  → UX Strategist (Refined prototype with technical constraints)
```
**Description**: Used for user-facing features where UX drives technical decisions (e.g., onboarding wizard, dashboard redesign).

#### Sequence 3: Accessibility Review
```
UX Strategist (Initial prototype)
  → UX Strategist (Accessibility audit identifies issues)
  → UX Strategist (Revised prototype addressing issues)
  → Human Designer Review
```
**Description**: Iterative accessibility compliance loop.

### Parallel Processing

**Can run in parallel with**:
- Data Analyst (UX design + metric validation are independent)
- GTM Strategist (UX design + positioning are independent)

**Must run sequentially after**:
- Engineering Partner's technical feasibility (UX needs to know technical constraints like API latency for loading state design)

**Must complete before**:
- Final PRD approval (design is a quality gate)
- Engineering implementation (developers need prototypes as reference)

---

## Performance Expectations

### Speed Targets

- **Simple prototype** (single form or card component): < 15 minutes
- **Moderate prototype** (multi-step flow with 3-5 components): < 45 minutes
- **Complex prototype** (full feature with 10+ components, responsive, accessible): < 2 hours
- **Accessibility audit**: < 30 minutes (for moderate complexity)
- **IA diagram**: < 20 minutes

### Quality Metrics

**Phase 1-2 Targets**:
- **Accessibility compliance**: 90% of prototypes pass WCAG 2.1 AA (18+/20 criteria)
- **Developer satisfaction**: 85% of engineering team rates prototypes as "helpful" or "very helpful"
- **Design consistency**: 95% of components reuse existing design patterns

**Phase 3+ Targets** (after System Evaluator active):
- **Accessibility compliance**: 100% pass WCAG 2.1 AA
- **User testing success rate**: 80% of users complete tasks on first attempt with prototype
- **Implementation accuracy**: 90% of final implementations match prototype design

## Examples & Test Cases

### Example 1: Simple Form Prototype

**Input**:
```
Product Architect: "Generate prototype for newsletter signup form"
PRD excerpt: "User enters email address, clicks subscribe, sees confirmation message"
```

**Expected Output**:
```typescript
// execution/prototypes/2026-02-01_Prototype_Newsletter-Signup.tsx

export const NewsletterSignup: React.FC = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<'idle' | 'success'>('idle');

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Simulate API call
    setStatus('success');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="max-w-md mx-auto p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
        Subscribe to Newsletter
      </h2>

      {status === 'idle' && (
        <>
          <label htmlFor="email" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">
            Email Address
          </label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="email"
            value={email}
            onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
            required
            className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent"
            placeholder="you@example.com"
            aria-describedby="email-hint"
          />
          <p id="email-hint" className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1">
            We'll never share your email.
          </p>

          <button
            type="submit"
            className="mt-4 w-full px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2"
          >
            Subscribe
          </button>
        </>
      )}

      {status === 'success' && (
        <div className="p-4 bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-md">
          <p className="text-green-800 font-medium">
            ✓ Successfully subscribed! Check your email for confirmation.
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
    </form>
  );
};
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Uses React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- [ ] Semantic HTML (form, label, input, button)
- [ ] Accessible (label for input, aria-describedby for hint)
- [ ] Responsive (max-w-md for mobile friendliness)
- [ ] Focus states styled with focus:ring

### Example 2: User Flow for Complex Feature

**Input**:
```
Product Architect: "Create user flow for document collaboration feature"
PRD includes: Invite users, real-time editing, conflict resolution
```

**Expected Output**:
```markdown
# User Flow: Document Collaboration

[Mermaid flowchart showing:]
- User opens document
- Checks if collaborators already added (decision point)
- If no: Shows invite dialog → User adds emails → Sends invites
- If yes: Enters edit mode
- Real-time sync updates shown
- If conflict detected: Shows resolution UI → User chooses version
- Saves successfully → Shows confirmation
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] All user decisions mapped as diamond shapes
- [ ] Error paths included (e.g., "What if invite email invalid?")
- [ ] Success and failure end states defined

---

## Known Limitations

### What This Agent Does NOT Do

- ❌ **Write production frontend code**: UX Strategist creates prototypes for reference, not production-ready implementations
- ❌ **Conduct user research**: Does not run interviews, surveys, or usability tests (references existing research from Product Architect)
- ❌ **Create visual design assets**: Generates functional prototypes with Tailwind classes, not high-fidelity graphic design mockups
- ❌ **Write backend code**: Focuses on frontend/UI only (Engineering Partner handles backend)
- ❌ **Make product decisions**: If design conflicts with business goals, escalate to Product Architect

### Edge Cases Requiring Human Judgment

**Escalate to Human Designer When**:
- Novel UI pattern outside existing design system (requires design system governance decision)
- Accessibility conflict with business requirement (e.g., "make CTA button smaller" conflicts with touch target size)
- Branding/visual identity questions (logo placement, color palette expansion)
- Complex animation or micro-interaction specifications (beyond prototype scope)

**Flag for Product Architect Review When**:
- Proposed UX significantly changes user workflow from PRD
- Technical constraints make ideal UX unfeasible (requires product trade-off decision)
- Accessibility compliance requires descoping feature functionality
