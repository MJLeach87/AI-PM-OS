## Examples & Test Cases

### Example 1: Value Proposition for PM OS

**Input**:
```
GTM Strategist: "Create value proposition for PM OS targeting enterprise product teams (50-200 person engineering orgs)"
```

**Expected Output** (`execution/gtm/2026-02-01_ValueProp_PM-OS.md`):
```markdown
# Value Proposition: PM OS

## Target Customer Segment
- **Who**: Enterprise Product Managers at B2B SaaS companies (50-200 person engineering teams)
- **Pain Points**:
  - Spend 80% of time on documentation, 20% on strategy (should be reversed)
  - PRDs take 8+ hours to draft, leading to rushed discovery
  - Engineering rework due to incomplete or ambiguous specs (40% of PRDs require major edits)
  - Product decisions lack data grounding (relying on intuition vs. metrics)

## Problem Statement
Product Managers at high-growth SaaS companies are drowning in administrative work (PRD drafting, ticket management, stakeholder updates), leaving insufficient time for strategic discovery, customer research, and data-driven decision-making. This results in lower-quality product decisions, engineering rework, and slower time-to-market.

## Solution
PM OS is a self-improving AI-powered product management system that automates artifact generation (OSTs, PRDs, technical specs, prototypes) while grounding decisions in organizational strategy and quantitative evidence. By handling the "document-authoring" work, PM OS frees PMs to focus on high-leverage strategic thinking.

### Example 2: Battle Card vs. Productboard

**Input**:
```
GTM Strategist: "Create battle card for PM OS vs. Productboard"
```

**Expected Output** (`execution/gtm/2026-02-01_BattleCard_Productboard.md`):
```markdown
# Battle Card: PM OS vs. Productboard

## Quick Overview

| Category | PM OS | Productboard |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Positioning** | AI-powered artifact generation system for high-velocity product teams | Product management platform for idea-to-roadmap workflow |
| **Target Market** | Enterprise SaaS companies (50-200 eng), engineering-heavy cultures | Mid-market to enterprise B2B/B2C companies |
| **Key Strength** | Automated PRD/spec generation with AI agents | Robust idea management and prioritization framework |
| **Pricing** | (TBD - likely per-PM seat) | $20-$60/user/month (Pro-Enterprise tiers) |
| **Ideal For** | PMs drowning in documentation, need execution speed | PMs struggling with idea overload, need prioritization structure |

## Strengths (Why PM OS Wins)

1. **Execution Velocity - 50-80% Faster Time-to-Spec**
   - PM OS: < 4 hours from hypothesis to dev-ready PRD (automated agents)
   - Productboard: Still requires manual PRD writing (just stores the idea/priority)
   - **Proof**: PM OS Artifact Search Filter spec'd in 1 day vs. typical 3-5 days

2. **Quality - Zero-Clarification Sprint Readiness (> 95%)**
   - PM OS: Engineering Partner validates technical feasibility + security upfront
   - Productboard: No technical validation layer (PMs discover issues in sprint planning)
   - **Proof**: PM OS PRDs include Gherkin scenarios, API contracts, security assessments

3. **Self-Improvement - System Evolves With Your Team**
   - PM OS: System Evaluator proposes improvements (70% self-generated by Phase 3)
   - Productboard: Manual process improvement (no self-improvement loop)
   - **Proof**: PM OS upgraded Engineering Partner v1.1 → v1.2 autonomously

4. **Strategic Alignment - 100% Identity Traceability**
   - PM OS: Organizational strategy version-controlled as code (auto-injected context)
   - Productboard: Strategy alignment manual (no automatic enforcement)
   - **Proof**: Every PM OS artifact cites vision/mission connection

## Weaknesses (Where Productboard Wins)

1. **Maturity - Productboard is Battle-Tested (Founded 2014)**
   - Productboard: 10+ years in market, proven at scale (6,000+ customers)
   - PM OS: Phase 1 (early adopter stage), proven via dogfooding only
   - **Mitigation**: "PM OS successfully built itself (meta-recursive validation). We're early but proven in production use for our own development."

2. **Ecosystem - Productboard Has Broader Integrations**
   - Productboard: 50+ integrations (Jira, Slack, Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
   - PM OS: Phase 2 focus on Atlassian ecosystem (Jira, Confluence), expanding to Slack/Snowflake
   - **Mitigation**: "We prioritize deep integration over breadth. Our MCP architecture enables rapid integration expansion based on your stack."

3. **User Feedback Management - Productboard Specializes in Idea Intake**
   - Productboard: Portal for customer feedback, voting, impact scores
   - PM OS: Focuses on execution artifacts (PRDs, specs), less on idea intake workflow
   - **Mitigation**: "PM OS complements feedback tools - we excel at turning validated ideas into execution-ready specs. Use Productboard for intake, PM OS for execution."

## Common Objections & Responses

**Objection 1**: "We're already using Productboard - why switch?"
- **Response**: "You don't need to switch - PM OS complements Productboard. Use Productboard for idea management and prioritization, then hand validated features to PM OS for automated PRD/spec generation. Many teams use both."
- **Proof Point**: PM OS integrates with Jira (like Productboard) - we fit your existing workflow.

**Objection 2**: "How do I know AI-generated PRDs will be high quality?"
- **Response**: "PM OS uses specialized agents (Engineering Partner, UX Strategist, Data Analyst) with quality gates at every step. We achieve > 95% 'zero-clarification' sprint readiness. Plus, PM OS built itself - our own PRDs are generated by the system."
- **Proof Point**: Share PM OS validation reports showing 5/5 tests passed, zero-clarification success.

**Objection 3**: "This sounds expensive - Productboard is already $20-60/user/month."
- **Response**: "ROI calculation: If PM OS saves 50% of PRD drafting time (4h/week), that's 200h/year saved per PM. At $100/h PM cost, that's $20k/year value per PM. Our pricing (TBD) will reflect ROI, not just cost."
- **Proof Point**: Share case study showing time savings (when available).

## Trap-Setting Questions

Use these questions to expose Productboard's weaknesses and highlight PM OS strengths:

1. **"How long does it take your PMs to go from prioritized idea to dev-ready PRD?"**
   - *Why it works*: Exposes that Productboard stops at prioritization - manual PRD writing still required
   - *PM OS Advantage*: < 4 hours with automated agents

2. **"Do your PRDs consistently pass sprint planning without clarification questions from engineering?"**
   - *Why it works*: Highlights lack of technical validation in Productboard
   - *PM OS Advantage*: Engineering Partner validates feasibility + security upfront

3. **"How do you ensure every feature aligns with your company's strategic vision?"**
   - *Why it works*: Strategy alignment in Productboard is manual (tagging/scoring)
   - *PM OS Advantage*: Automated identity layer injection (100% traceability)

4. **"Does your product management system improve itself based on learnings over time?"**
   - *Why it works*: No self-improvement loop in Productboard
   - *PM OS Advantage*: System Evaluator proposes improvements (70% self-generated by Phase 3)

## When to Compete Aggressively

**Strong PM OS Fit** (Go Head-to-Head):
- Enterprise SaaS companies (50-200 person engineering teams)
- Engineering-heavy cultures valuing technical rigor
- Teams frustrated with slow PRD drafting process
- Organizations with strong strategic vision needing consistent alignment

**Weak PM OS Fit** (Don't Compete / Partner):
- Small teams (< 10 engineers) - may not need AI automation
- B2C companies with high volume idea intake needs (Productboard's strength)
- Teams satisfied with current PRD velocity and quality
- Organizations lacking clear strategic vision (PM OS requires strong identity layer)

## Pricing Positioning

**Productboard**: $20-60/user/month (Pro to Enterprise tiers)
**PM OS** (Projected): $50-150/PM/month - premium pricing justified by ROI
- **Rationale**: PM OS saves 200h/year per PM (4h/week * 50 weeks). At $100/h, that's $20k/year value. Pricing at $1,800/year ($150/month) = 9% of value created = strong ROI.

## Summary: When PM OS Wins

Use PM OS when:
- ✅ Execution speed matters more than idea management
- ✅ Engineering teams demand high-quality, complete specs
- ✅ Strategic alignment enforcement is critical
- ✅ Team values AI-powered automation and self-improvement

Use Productboard when:
- ❌ Idea intake and prioritization workflow is the primary pain
- ❌ Need broad ecosystem integrations (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
- ❌ Early-stage company without clear strategic vision (PM OS requires strong identity layer)

**Hybrid Approach**: Use Productboard for intake/prioritization, PM OS for execution artifacts. Both tools can coexist.

### Example 3: Positioning Statement (Geoffrey Moore Format)

**Input**:
```
GTM Strategist: "Create positioning statement for PM OS"
```

**Expected Output** (`execution/gtm/2026-02-01_Positioning_PM-OS.md`):
```markdown
# Positioning Statement: PM OS

## Positioning Statement (Geoffrey Moore Format)

**For** enterprise Product Managers at high-growth B2B SaaS companies (50-200 person engineering teams)

**Who** are drowning in documentation work (PRDs, specs, tickets) and struggle to find time for strategic discovery and data-driven decision-making

**The PM OS** is an AI-powered product management automation system

**That** transforms PMs from document-authors into Strategic Architects by automating artifact generation (OSTs, PRDs, technical specs, prototypes) while grounding all decisions in organizational strategy and quantitative evidence

**Unlike** Productboard (idea management platforms) or manual tools (Google Docs + Jira)

**Our product** uses specialized AI agents (Product Architect, Engineering Partner, UX Strategist) that self-improve over time and institutionalize your product strategy as executable code, achieving 50-80% faster time-to-spec with > 95% sprint-ready quality

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Execution Velocity - 50-80% Faster Time-to-Spec
**Why it matters**: Product teams ship features weeks/months faster when PRD drafting goes from 8+ hours to < 4 hours.
**Proof point**: PM OS Artifact Search Filter spec'd in 1 day (OST → PRD → Tech Spec → Prototype) vs. typical 3-5 days for manual process.
**How we deliver**: Multi-agent architecture (Product Architect, Engineering Partner, UX Strategist) working in parallel to generate dev-ready artifacts automatically.

### 2. Quality - > 95% "Zero-Clarification" Sprint Readiness
**Why it matters**: Engineering rework consumes 20-40% of sprint capacity when PRDs are incomplete or ambiguous. Zero-clarification PRDs eliminate this waste.
**Proof point**: PM OS PRDs include technical feasibility validation (Engineering Partner), Gherkin acceptance scenarios, API contracts, and security assessments - all before sprint planning.
**How we deliver**: Engineering Partner agent validates technical feasibility and security upfront, ensuring specs are complete and unambiguous before handoff.

### 3. Self-Improvement - System Evolves With Your Team
**Why it matters**: Traditional PM tools are static - they don't learn from your team's patterns or improve over time. PM OS gets smarter as you use it.
**Proof point**: PM OS upgraded its own Engineering Partner agent from v1.1 to v1.2 (added information security assessment as primary factor). By Phase 3, system generates 70% of its own improvements.
**How we deliver**: System Evaluator agent (Phase 3) audits quality weekly and proposes improvements as pull requests. Human PM reviews and approves. Agents evolve with your learnings.

### 4. Strategic Alignment - 100% Identity Traceability
**Why it matters**: Prevents "why are we building this?" syndrome. Ensures every feature ladders up to company vision and North Star Metrics.
**Proof point**: Every PM OS artifact explicitly cites organizational strategy (vision, mission, NSM connection). Identity layer version-controlled as code and auto-injected into agent context.
**How we deliver**: Organizational intelligence (strategy, standards, roadmap) stored as code in identity layer. Agents automatically load relevant context before generating artifacts. Validation gates enforce alignment.

**Message**: "ROI: 200h/year saved per PM (4h/week). At $100/h cost, that's $20k/year value per PM. Break-even at $1,800/year cost ($150/month)."

## Launch Positioning (Phase 2+)

**Positioning for Beta/Early Access** (Current):
- "Join the Product Management Revolution - Be Among the First"
- Target: Early adopter product teams willing to provide feedback
- Messaging: Emphasize innovation, self-improvement, meta-recursive validation
- Risk mitigation: "We dogfooded PM OS to build itself - proven in production for our own development"

**Positioning for General Availability** (Phase 3+):
- "The Self-Improving Product Management System for High-Velocity Teams"
- Target: Mainstream enterprise product teams
- Messaging: Emphasize speed, quality, strategic alignment
- Social proof: Case studies, customer testimonials, quantified impact

## Anti-Positioning (What We Are NOT)

To sharpen positioning, be clear about what PM OS is **not**:

- ❌ **Not** a roadmapping tool (use Productboard, Aha!, Jira Roadmaps for that)
- ❌ **Not** a user feedback portal (use Productboard, Canny, UserVoice for idea intake)
- ❌ **Not** a replacement for Product Managers (AI generates, humans approve - hybrid intelligence)
- ❌ **Not** a generic AI assistant (we're purpose-built for PM workflows with organizational memory)
- ❌ **Not** a low-code/no-code platform (we automate artifacts, not software development)

**What We ARE**: An AI-powered system that automates execution artifacts (PRDs, specs, prototypes) for high-velocity product teams who value technical rigor and strategic alignment.
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Geoffrey Moore format followed correctly
- [ ] Differentiators specific and quantified
- [ ] Proof points from actual PM OS artifacts
- [ ] Messaging by audience tailored appropriately
- [ ] Anti-positioning clarifies boundaries

## Known Limitations

### What This Agent Does NOT Do

- ❌ **Direct customer research**: Conducting interviews, surveys, usability tests (Product Architect + UX Strategist domain)
- ❌ **Graphic design**: Creating visual assets, logos, brand guidelines (hire designer or use UX Strategist for UI only)
- ❌ **Sales execution**: Negotiating deals, delivering pitches (GTM Strategist provides materials, sales team executes)
- ❌ **Pricing decisions**: Final pricing authority (GTM Strategist provides analysis, executive team decides)
- ❌ **Marketing campaign execution**: Running ads, managing social media (GTM Strategist provides messaging, marketing team executes)

### Edge Cases Requiring Human Judgment

- **High-stakes positioning** (enterprise sales, major product launches): Human PM should review and refine positioning before external use
- **Legal/regulatory claims**: Any competitive claims or value propositions with legal risk (e.g., healthcare, finance) require legal review
- **Controversial competitive positioning**: If battle card includes aggressive claims, human PM should validate with executive team
- **Pricing for new markets**: When entering unfamiliar markets, pricing recommendations require validation with finance/sales leadership
