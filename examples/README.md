# PM OS Inception Materials

This directory contains **PM OS building itself** - the artifacts and documentation generated during Phases 0-1 when PM OS was used to design, validate, and improve its own architecture.

**Purpose**: These files serve as:
1. **Proof of concept**: PM OS successfully managed its own development (meta-recursive)
2. **Quality reference**: Examples of expected output quality for discovery, PRDs, technical specs, and prototypes
3. **Historical record**: Documentation of PM OS's self-improvement journey

**Important**: These are **examples**, not templates. User artifacts should be created in `execution/` (currently empty and ready for your work).

---

## Historical Context: Metrics Evolution

**Important**: Artifacts in `examples/artifacts/` were created during Phase 0-1 using the original North Star Metrics (volume-based: PRD time reduction, rework reduction, artifact count).

Starting Phase 2, PM OS transitioned to a flexible metric framework emphasizing:
- **Strategic Velocity** (Time-to-Spec)
- **Technical Quality** (Zero-Clarification Sprint Readiness)
- **Discovery Logic** (Hypothesis-to-Halt)
- **Organizational Cohesion** (Identity Traceability)

These examples remain valuable as baseline demonstrations, showing PM OS capabilities under the original framework. See `identity/STRATEGY.md` for the current flexible metric framework where organizations choose 3-4 metrics based on their maturity and context.

## Directory Structure

### `identity/` - PM OS's Own Organizational Context

**PM OS's meta-recursive organizational intelligence** (reference examples, read-only):

**Files**:
- **`README.md`**: Explains PM OS's own organizational context and how it relates to YOUR `identity/` customization files
- **`STRATEGY.md`**: PM OS's vision ("Transform PMs into Strategic Architects"), mission, North Star Metrics
- **`STANDARDS.md`**: PM OS's brand voice (professional, technical, concise), tech stack (React, TypeScript, Node.js)
- **`ROADMAP.md`**: PM OS's Phase 0-7 implementation timeline (how PM OS builds itself)

**Purpose**:
1. **Reference examples**: Show what a complete Identity Layer looks like
2. **PM OS meta-documentation**: The organizational context PM OS uses to build itself
3. **Structural templates**: Demonstrate how to structure YOUR own identity files

**IMPORTANT**: These are PM OS's actual files (reference only, don't edit). For customization templates, see `identity/` directory (parent folder) - those files have "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" headers and should be replaced with YOUR company's information.

**What to learn**: How to structure organizational strategy, standards, and roadmap as version-controlled code that agents can automatically load.

## How to Use These Examples

### For New PM OS Users

**Start here**:
1. Read the main [README.md](../README.md) for product overview
2. **Customize YOUR identity layer**: See [identity/README.md](../identity/README.md) for step-by-step guide
3. Review **identity/** to see PM OS's own organizational context (reference example)
4. Review **artifacts/** to see expected output quality
5. Check **validation-reports/** to understand quality standards
6. Begin creating your own artifacts in `execution/` (not here)

**Key insight**: These examples show PM OS's "dogfooding" approach - the system was used to build itself from Day 1, and has its own Identity Layer just like users should create for their organizations.

### For Understanding PM OS Capabilities

**Discovery workflow**:
- OST → PRD → Technical Feasibility → Security Assessment → Prototype → Implementation

**Follow the artifact chain**:
1. `discovery/2026-01-31_OST_PM-OS-Discovery-Improvements.md` (problem space)
2. `prds/2026-01-31_PRD_Artifact-Search-Filter_v0.1.md` (solution spec)
3. `technical_specs/2026-02-01_Feasibility_Artifact-Search.md` (technical validation)
4. `technical_specs/2026-02-01_Implementation_Artifact-Search.md` (implementation plan)
5. `prototypes/2026-02-01_Prototype_Artifact-Search-Filter.tsx` (working prototype)

This demonstrates PM OS's end-to-end feature development pipeline.

### For Quality Benchmarking

When creating your own artifacts, reference these examples for:

**Writing style**: Professional, technical, concise (per `identity/STANDARDS.md`)
**Structure**: Follow templates in `templates/` directory
**Evidence**: Data-driven decisions with clear reasoning
**Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of business, technical, and UX dimensions

---

## What NOT to Do

**Don't modify files in examples/** - they're historical records and reference examples. Create new artifacts in `execution/` instead.

**Don't treat artifacts as templates** - use actual templates in `templates/` directory. These are completed examples showing what good output looks like.

**Don't confuse with your work**:
- YOUR artifacts go in `execution/`, not `examples/artifacts/`
- YOUR organizational context goes in `identity/` (customize templates), not `examples/identity/` (PM OS's reference examples)

**Don't edit examples/identity/ files** - these are PM OS's own organizational context (read-only reference). Edit `identity/` files instead (templates with "🔧 CUSTOMIZE THIS" headers).

---

## Meta-Recursive Development

PM OS demonstrates **meta-recursive** self-improvement:

**Identity Layer**: PM OS has its own organizational context
- **examples/identity/STRATEGY.md**: PM OS's vision to transform PMs
- **examples/identity/ROADMAP.md**: PM OS's 7-phase implementation plan
- **examples/identity/STANDARDS.md**: PM OS's quality standards
- Agents reference these files when working on PM OS improvements

**Phase 0**: PM OS defined its own architecture
- Product Architect generated agent specifications
- Orchestrator routed tasks to appropriate specialists
- Quality gates enforced standards automatically

**Phase 1**: PM OS designed its own technical enhancements
- Engineering Partner v1.2 added information security assessment
- UX Strategist created prototype for artifact search
- End-to-end workflow validated with real PM OS features

**Future Phases**: System Evaluator (Phase 3) will audit and propose its own improvements.

**Why this matters**: Proves PM OS works before asking users to adopt it. These examples are the "receipts" - tangible proof the system delivers what it promises. PM OS practices what it preaches by maintaining its own Identity Layer.

## File Naming Conventions (Reference)

All artifacts follow standardized naming:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_[artifact-type]_[brief-title].md
```

**Examples**:
- `2026-01-31_OST_PM-OS-Discovery-Improvements.md`
- `2026-01-31_PRD_Artifact-Search-Filter_v0.1.md`
- `2026-02-01_Feasibility_Artifact-Search.md`
- `2026-02-01_Prototype_Artifact-Search-Filter.tsx`

**Rationale**: Chronological sorting, clear artifact type identification, human-readable titles.
