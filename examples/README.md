# PM OS Inception Materials

This directory contains **PM OS building itself** - the artifacts and documentation generated during Phases 0-1 when PM OS was used to design, validate, and improve its own architecture.

**Purpose**: These files serve as:
1. **Proof of concept**: PM OS successfully managed its own development (meta-recursive)
2. **Quality reference**: Examples of expected output quality for discovery, PRDs, technical specs, and prototypes
3. **Historical record**: Documentation of PM OS's self-improvement journey

**Important**: These are **examples**, not templates. User artifacts should be created in `execution/` (currently empty and ready for your work).

## Historical Context: Metrics Evolution

**Important**: Artifacts in `examples/artifacts/` were created during Phase 0-1 using the original North Star Metrics (volume-based: PRD time reduction, rework reduction, artifact count).

Starting Phase 2, PM OS transitioned to a flexible metric framework emphasizing:
- **Strategic Velocity** (Time-to-Spec)
- **Technical Quality** (Zero-Clarification Sprint Readiness)
- **Discovery Logic** (Hypothesis-to-Halt)
- **Organizational Cohesion** (Identity Traceability)

These examples remain valuable as baseline demonstrations, showing PM OS capabilities under the original framework. See `identity/STRATEGY.md` for the current flexible metric framework where organizations choose 3-4 metrics based on their maturity and context.

### `documentation/` - PM OS Process Documentation

Meta-documentation about PM OS's development process:

#### `phase-history/`
Historical records of phase completion:
- **PHASE_0_STATUS.md**: Phase 0 bootstrap progress tracking
- **PHASE_0_COMPLETE.md**: Phase 0 completion summary with validation results
- **PHASE_1_WORKFLOW_VALIDATION.md**: Phase 1 end-to-end workflow validation

**Purpose**: Track phase milestones, record completion criteria, document validation approach

#### `validation-reports/`
Comprehensive test results proving PM OS capabilities:
- **TEST_1_VALIDATION_REPORT.md**: Orchestrator + Product Architect validation (Tests 1-2)
- **TEST_2_VALIDATION_REPORT.md**: Engineering Partner validation (Tests 3-4)
- **TEST_3_4_5_VALIDATION_REPORT.md**: End-to-end workflow validation (Tests 3-5)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate quality standards, provide validation methodology reference, prove system works

#### `changelogs/`
Agent evolution documentation:
- **ENGINEERING_PARTNER_V1.2_CHANGELOG.md**: v1.1 → v1.2 enhancement (information security as primary factor)

**Purpose**: Track agent improvements, document capability evolution, maintain upgrade history

#### `research/`
Background research and implementation summaries:
- **PM_OS_Deep_Research_Report.md**: Comprehensive market research, competitive analysis, technical feasibility
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: High-level overview of PM OS architecture and implementation approach
- **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**: Current phase progress and roadmap tracking (extracted from main README)

**Purpose**: Preserve strategic context, document research findings, track implementation progress

## How to Use These Examples

### For New PM OS Users

**Start here**:
1. Read the main [README.md](../README.md) for product overview
2. Review **artifacts/** to see expected output quality
3. Check **validation-reports/** to understand quality standards
4. Begin creating your own artifacts in `execution/` (not here)

**Key insight**: These examples show PM OS's "dogfooding" approach - the system was used to build itself from Day 1.

### For Understanding PM OS Capabilities

**Discovery workflow**:
- OST → PRD → Technical Feasibility → Security Assessment → Prototype → Implementation

**Follow the artifact chain**:
1. `discovery/2026-01-31_OST_PM-OS-Discovery-Improvements.md` (problem space)
2. `prds/2026-01-31_PRD_Artifact-Search-Filter_v0.1.md` (solution spec)
3. `technical_specs/2026-02-01_Feasibility_Artifact-Search.md` (technical validation)
4. `technical_specs/2026-02-01_Implementation_Artifact-Search.md` (implementation plan)
5. `prototypes/2026-02-01_Prototype_Artifact-Search-Filter.tsx` (working prototype)

This demonstrates PM OS's end-to-end feature development pipeline.

### For Quality Benchmarking

When creating your own artifacts, reference these examples for:

**Writing style**: Professional, technical, concise (per `identity/STANDARDS.md`)
**Structure**: Follow templates in `templates/` directory
**Evidence**: Data-driven decisions with clear reasoning
**Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of business, technical, and UX dimensions

---

## What NOT to Do

**Don't modify these files** - they're historical records. Create new artifacts in `execution/` instead.

**Don't treat as templates** - use actual templates in `templates/` directory. These are completed examples showing what good output looks like.

**Don't confuse with your work** - your artifacts go in `execution/`, not `examples/`.

## Meta-Recursive Development

PM OS demonstrates **meta-recursive** self-improvement:

**Phase 0**: PM OS defined its own architecture
- Product Architect generated agent specifications
- Orchestrator routed tasks to appropriate specialists
- Quality gates enforced standards automatically

**Phase 1**: PM OS designed its own technical enhancements
- Engineering Partner v1.2 added information security assessment
- UX Strategist created prototype for artifact search
- End-to-end workflow validated with real PM OS features

**Future Phases**: System Evaluator (Phase 3) will audit and propose its own improvements.

**Why this matters**: Proves PM OS works before asking users to adopt it. These examples are the "receipts" - tangible proof the system delivers what it promises.

## File Naming Conventions (Reference)

All artifacts follow standardized naming:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_[artifact-type]_[brief-title].md
```

**Examples**:
- `2026-01-31_OST_PM-OS-Discovery-Improvements.md`
- `2026-01-31_PRD_Artifact-Search-Filter_v0.1.md`
- `2026-02-01_Feasibility_Artifact-Search.md`
- `2026-02-01_Prototype_Artifact-Search-Filter.tsx`

**Rationale**: Chronological sorting, clear artifact type identification, human-readable titles.
