# PM OS Phase 1 Implementation Plan

**Phase**: 1 - Core Agent Team + Google Drive MCP
**Duration**: Weeks 3-5 (3 weeks)
**Status**: Ready for Execution (Phase 0 Complete)
**Generated By**: Product Architect Agent (Test 5 - Self-Articulation)
**Created**: 2026-01-31

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 establishes PM OS's specialized agent team and enables access to legacy organizational documents via Google Drive MCP integration. This phase transforms PM OS from a bootstrap foundation (Orchestrator + Product Architect) into a functional multi-agent system capable of end-to-end feature development workflows (Discovery → Feasibility → Prototype).

**Key Innovation**: Product Architect agent generates Engineering Partner and UX Strategist specs using `templates/agent_spec_template.md`, demonstrating PM OS's self-building capability.

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (Weeks 3-5)
**New Agents**: 2 (Engineering Partner, UX Strategist)
**New MCP Integrations**: 1 (Google Drive)
**Expected Capability Gain**: 200% (from 1 agent to 3 agents)

---

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Establish specialized agent team enabling end-to-end feature development workflows

**Success Definition** (from identity/ROADMAP.md:48-54):
- ✅ 3 specialized agents operational in both Cursor and Claude Code
- ✅ Google Drive MCP retrieves documents in < 3 seconds
- ✅ End-to-end workflow functional: Discovery → Feasibility → Prototype
- ✅ First complete artifact set generated (OST → PRD → Tech Spec → Prototype)

**Strategic Alignment** (identity/STRATEGY.md):
- **Vision**: "Augment PMs into AI-powered product leaders" - Phase 1 adds technical and UX expertise
- **North Star**: 50% reduction in PRD time - Engineering Partner reduces rework, UX Strategist accelerates prototyping
- **Principle**: Self-Building - Product Architect generates new agent specs, PM OS expands itself

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Agent spec generation incomplete** | Low | High | Product Architect tested in Test 3, proven capable. Use template strictly. |
| **Google Drive MCP OAuth fails** | Medium | Medium | Follow setup guide step-by-step, test with Google sample app first. |
| **Routing conflicts between agents** | Low | Medium | Clear keyword separation (technical vs UX vs discovery), test routing thoroughly. |
| **Generated tech specs lack quality** | Medium | High | Engineering Partner includes validation checklists, human PM review required. |
| **Prototypes not accessible** | Low | High | UX Strategist has accessibility audit built-in, test with screen reader. |

### Organizational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Scope creep (add more agents)** | Medium | Medium | Strict adherence to Phase 1 scope (only 2 agents + 1 MCP). Defer others to Phase 2. |
| **Google Drive credential leakage** | Low | Critical | Multiple safeguards: .gitignore, .env.example, setup guide warnings, quarterly rotation. |
| **Agents generate conflicting specs** | Low | Medium | Clear workflow sequence (Product Arch → Eng Partner → UX Strategist prevents overlap). |
| **Onboarding time longer than expected** | Medium | Low | Allocate 3 weeks, not 2. Day-by-day checklist prevents rushing. |
